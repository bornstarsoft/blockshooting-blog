Konami has officially announced that the highly anticipated multiplayer mode, Fox Hunt, for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, is set to release in Fall 2025. This mode promises to deliver a fresh online experience, distinct from the previous Metal Gear Online, and is being developed by veteran designer Yu Sahara, known for his work on several titles in the series. 

Fox Hunt aims to blend the classic sneaking gameplay of the Metal Gear series with modern multiplayer dynamics, utilizing popular game rules from its predecessor while enhancing the graphical experience. As the gaming landscape evolves, Sahara emphasizes the importance of adapting to new multiplayer trends, ensuring that both long-time fans and newcomers can enjoy a contemporary gaming experience.

With the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 launching on August 28, 2025, excitement is building not just for the single-player experience but also for the innovative multiplayer mode that Fox Hunt promises to bring. Will this new mode capture the essence of what made Metal Gear Online a fan favorite? Only time will tell.
