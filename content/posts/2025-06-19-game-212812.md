NINES has officially announced their upcoming puzzle game, Pipeworks Puzzle, and it’s shaping up to be a delightful addition to the genre. This game takes the classic tile sliding puzzle concept and adds a unique twist that promises to engage players with its charming visuals and soothing soundtrack. The reveal, which included an enticing trailer shared across various platforms, has already generated a buzz among puzzle enthusiasts and casual gamers alike.

In Pipeworks Puzzle, players step into the shoes of a plumber at a bustling construction site, tasked with arranging disordered pipe pieces to match a specific blueprint. The gameplay is set within a grid-based arena, where movement is limited to the cardinal directions—up, down, left, and right. Adding a layer of depth to the experience is a support character named ‘Boss’, designed by the talented PokuriMio, who will guide players from novice to master plumber. This character not only enhances the narrative but also adds a touch of personality to the game.

Excitingly, Pipeworks Puzzle is already available for wishlisting on Steam, with the promise of unlocking new features such as an endless mode, speedrun challenges, and even multiplayer battles. A demo is also on the horizon, allowing players to get a taste of the gameplay before its official release later this year. As the gaming community eagerly awaits more updates, one can’t help but wonder how this innovative approach will resonate with fans of the genre.
