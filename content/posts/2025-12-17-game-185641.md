November 2025 witnessed a remarkable surge in viewership for anime-style RPGs, with major titles like Kuro Games' *Wuthering Waves* and miHoYo's *Zenless Zone Zero* leading the charge. The Niko Partners China Games & Livestreaming Tracker highlights how these games not only captivated audiences but also leveraged significant updates and events to boost their visibility and engagement on platforms like Bilibili, Huya, and Douyu.

*Wuthering Waves* achieved an impressive 36.5 million viewers, a staggering 103% increase month-over-month, while *Zenless Zone Zero* followed closely with 30.9 million viewers, marking an 84% rise.
