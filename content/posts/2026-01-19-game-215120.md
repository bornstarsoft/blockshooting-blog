SEGA is gearing up for a spectacular celebration as Puyo Puyo marks its 35th anniversary in 2026, joining Sonic the Hedgehog in a year of nostalgia and excitement. The company has unveiled the "Dairensa!" project, a nod to a beloved song from the franchise, along with a series of initiatives that promise to engage fans worldwide.

Among the highlights is a special live stream scheduled for February 1, 2026, featuring voice actors, live demos, and updates on the mobile game Puyo Puyo!! Quest. Additionally, fans in Japan can look forward to exclusive pop-up stores and a collaborative lottery featuring prizes that celebrate both Puyo Puyo and Sonic. This dual anniversary approach not only amplifies the celebrations but also showcases SEGA's commitment to its iconic franchises.

As we look ahead to 2026, the anticipation builds for what promises to be an unforgettable year for SEGA fans. Will you be joining in the celebrations?
