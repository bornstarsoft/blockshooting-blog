The recent patch for NASCAR 25 has finally introduced a long-awaited feature: in-race pit stop adjustments. This addition has been highly requested by players since the game's launch, allowing for more strategic gameplay during races. Players can now tweak their car's tire pressure and wedge settings mid-race, enhancing the overall racing experience.

Initially, players were limited to making adjustments only before practice, qualifying, or race sessions, which left many feeling frustrated. However, with the latest update, the developers have listened to community feedback and implemented these crucial in-race adjustments. While the feature is a significant improvement, there are still some limitations, such as the inability to change only left-side tires during pit stops.

As NASCAR 25 continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how developers address these remaining issues and what other features might be added in future updates. Will we see even more customization options for pit stops? Only time will tell.
