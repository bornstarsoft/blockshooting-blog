In a recent revelation, NASCAR '25 Producer Matt Lewis confirmed that the tracks in the upcoming NASCAR console game are locked to their respective racing series. This decision has sparked discussions among fans who were hoping for the flexibility to race any series on any track, a feature that has been part of previous NASCAR games.

The confirmation came during an interview with OverTake_gg, where Lewis explained the complexities involved in tuning AI opponents and setting up unique configurations for each series across multiple tracks. While this limitation may disappoint some players, Lewis acknowledged the potential for this feature in future installments, indicating that it remains a priority for the development team.

As NASCAR '25 gears up for its release on October 14 for Xbox Series X/S and PS5, fans can still look forward to a diverse selection of tracks, including some that are not part of the real-world schedules. With the excitement building, one can't help but wonder how this decision will impact the gameplay experience and what future updates might bring.
