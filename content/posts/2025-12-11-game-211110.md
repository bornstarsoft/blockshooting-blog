As December approaches, PlayStation Plus subscribers are buzzing with excitement for the upcoming reveal of new games for the Extra and Premium tiers. With predictions swirling around titles like Assassin's Creed Mirage and Resident Evil 4 Remake, fans are eager to see if these anticipated games will make the cut. The official announcement is set for December 10 at 4:30 PM GMT, promising a fresh lineup that could enhance the gaming experience for PS4 and PS5 owners alike.

This month, players can look forward to a mix of new releases and classic titles, with the likes of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and Granblue Fantasy: Relink joining the Extra catalog. However, it's also a crucial time for gamers to check which titles are leaving the service, including popular games like Battlefield 2042 and Forspoken, making this a pivotal moment for subscribers to dive into their gaming backlog.

With the gaming community eagerly awaiting the reveal, one can't help but wonder: will December deliver the blockbuster titles fans are hoping for? Stay tuned for the announcement and get ready to update your gaming library!
