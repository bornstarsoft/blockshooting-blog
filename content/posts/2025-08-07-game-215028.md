In a recent Q&A session, Sony's CFO Lin Tao confirmed that the highly anticipated game Marathon is expected to launch by the end of March 2026. This announcement comes after the game was officially delayed, with Tao emphasizing that while they are optimistic about the release, it is not yet a firm commitment. The company is currently making modifications to the game, aiming to provide a clearer timeline in the autumn.

Additionally, Tao discussed the evolving management structure of Bungie, indicating that the studio's independence is diminishing as it integrates more closely with PlayStation Studios. This shift reflects Sony's long-term strategy to enhance collaboration and streamline operations within its gaming division. With these developments, fans are left wondering how this integration will impact Bungies creative direction and future titles.

As we look ahead, the gaming community is eager to see how these changes will unfold and what they mean for the future of both Marathon and Bungie. Will this integration lead to innovative new titles, or will it stifle Bungie's unique creative voice?
