In an exciting announcement, Japanese indie developer Anettai has unveiled "Hakoniwa Electric," a charming isometric puzzle game that promises to offer players a cozy and relaxing experience. Set to launch for Windows PC via Steam in late 2026, this game invites players to step into the shoes of Akari, a novice shopkeeper managing her grandpa's electronics store while he enjoys a tropical vacation.

The game features twelve delightful miniature stages, each brimming with intricate details and seasonal changes. Players will engage in light-hearted wiring puzzles that require no complex calculations or time constraints, allowing for a truly leisurely gaming experience.

With its nostalgic aesthetics and gentle storytelling, "Hakoniwa Electric" is shaping up to be a delightful addition to the indie gaming scene. Will you join Akari and her robot companion Lamp on this heartwarming journey? Let's look forward to the cozy adventures that await!
