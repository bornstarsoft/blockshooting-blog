In a daring move, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming title, **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**, boldly claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This statement not only highlights the developers' confidence but also taps into the nostalgia and high expectations surrounding the beloved Portal franchise. With Valve's reluctance to produce a third installment, fans of the genre are eager for a fresh experience that can capture the essence of what made Portal so special.

ChromaGun 2 is set in a testing environment reminiscent of Aperture Science, where players utilize a unique gun to manipulate colors and solve puzzles. While the game draws some visual parallels to Portal, the gameplay mechanics seem to align more closely with titles like Qube and Qube 2, focusing on colored blocks rather than the iconic portals. This shift in gameplay style could offer a refreshing take on puzzle-solving, appealing to both veterans of the genre and newcomers alike.

The original ChromaGun, released in 2016, received 'Mostly Positive' reviews, setting a solid foundation for its sequel. With a free demo available on Steam, players can get a taste of what to expect before the full release. As we look forward to the evolution of puzzle games, will ChromaGun 2 carve out its own legacy in the gaming world?
