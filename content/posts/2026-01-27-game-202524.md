Walmart has sparked excitement among gamers with a potential leak regarding the next GameCube titles to hit the Nintendo Switch Online service. According to a recent discovery, the retailer's website showcased a list of upcoming games that included the beloved classics Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2, which have yet to be officially announced by Nintendo. While this could be a simple error, it raises hopes for fans eager to revisit these iconic titles.

Currently, Nintendo has confirmed only three GameCube games for the service: Super Mario Sunshine, Pokmon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Pokmon Colosseum. With no release dates for these titles, the addition of Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2 could significantly enhance the gaming experience for subscribers of the Switch Online Expansion Pack. As the anticipation builds, its worth considering how these classic games could attract both nostalgic players and newcomers alike.

As we await official confirmation from Nintendo, one can't help but wonder: will these classic titles make their way to the service soon, and what other surprises might be in store for Nintendo fans?
