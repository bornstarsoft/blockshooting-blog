This simple yet exciting trick enhances the gaming experience, allowing players to delve deeper into the lore and visuals of the Metroid universe.

To activate this feature, ensure you hold down the START + SELECT buttons while booting up Metroid Fusion while it’s connected to Metroid Zero Mission.
