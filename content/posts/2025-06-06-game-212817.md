Get ready to dive into the mind-bending world of **UnLoop**, a new puzzle game that promises to twist your perception of time and space. Developed by CM Games, known for their previous title *Into the Radius 2*, UnLoop invites players to engage in a unique gameplay mechanic where you literally help yourself by recording and stacking your actions. This innovative approach not only enhances the puzzle-solving experience but also creates an immersive narrative set in a vibrant yet perilous space station.

Set against the backdrop of the Temporal Research Hub, players must navigate through a series of challenging environments filled with obstacles like turrets and laser walls. The game cleverly incorporates the concept of self-sacrifice, where players must first "die" to progress, adding a layer of strategy and depth. With various sectors to explore, including the Nexus Frame and Asset Assembly Factory, each area introduces new chaos-inducing mechanics that will keep players on their toes.

UnLoop is set to launch on Quest and Pico this fall, with a PC VR port planned for a later date. As we await its release, one can't help but wonder how this game will redefine the puzzle genre in virtual reality. Are you ready to unravel the mysteries of time in UnLoop?
