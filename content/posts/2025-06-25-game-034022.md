Linking **Metroid Zero Mission** to **Metroid Fusion** offers players a unique opportunity to unlock a hidden treasure: the Metroid Fusion picture gallery. This feature not only enhances the gaming experience but also connects two beloved titles in the Metroid franchise. To unlock this gallery, players simply need to hold down **START + SELECT** while booting up Metroid Fusion, ensuring their devices are connected via a link cable.

For those enjoying the Switch Online version of Metroid Zero Mission, the Fusion Gallery is already unlocked by default, thanks to the GBA app included in the Switch Online Expansion Pack. This makes it easier than ever for fans to dive into the rich lore and stunning visuals of the Metroid universe without the hassle of linking devices.

As gaming technology continues to evolve, itâ€™s exciting to see how classic titles like Metroid are being reimagined and made accessible to new audiences. Have you tried linking these games yet? What other hidden features do you think are waiting to be discovered?
