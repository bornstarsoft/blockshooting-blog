Steam has just unveiled five exciting new free games that you can download and keep forever, offering a fantastic opportunity for gamers looking to expand their library without spending a dime. From puzzle games to visual novels, there’s something for everyone, but the question remains: how many of these titles are actually worth your time?

First on the list is **GeTrix**, a Tetris-like puzzle game that utilizes camera-based hand-tracking controls. While it promises a unique gaming experience, it may take some getting used to. Then there's **CrimeBloc**, a gritty text-based MMO that has polarized players—some find it confusing, while others hail it as a masterpiece. If you enjoy narrative-driven experiences, this might be worth a shot.

For racing enthusiasts, **Drift Legends 2** offers a mixed bag of reviews, with some players suggesting that additional DLC is necessary for a complete experience. Meanwhile, **Future Cowboy** presents an intriguing premise as a visual novel where you take on the role of a futuristic cowboy detective, though it currently lacks a solid review consensus. Finally, **Ventomori** stands out as a co-op exploration puzzle game reminiscent of Portal 2, receiving generally positive feedback despite some noted bugs.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, these free titles provide a great way to explore new genres and gameplay mechanics. Which of these games will you be diving into first?
