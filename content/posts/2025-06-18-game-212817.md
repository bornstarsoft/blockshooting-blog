In a remarkable gesture of appreciation, ShiftUp has gifted all 300 of its employees a Nintendo Switch 2 to celebrate the phenomenal success of their game "Stella Blade," which has surpassed 3 million units sold. This move not only highlights the company's commitment to recognizing hard work but also sets a precedent in the gaming industry for employee rewards tied to performance.

The event, held on June 18, marks a significant milestone for ShiftUp, especially following their earlier gift of a PlayStation 5 Pro to employees upon the game's launch. "Stella Blade," an action-adventure title exclusive to PlayStation 5, has proven to be a blockbuster, with its PC version achieving over 1 million sales in just three days. The company's CEO, Kim Hyung-sik, emphasized the importance of fostering an environment where talent is rewarded, hinting at potential future developments for the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game.

This innovative approach to employee motivation not only boosts morale but also encourages a culture of excellence within the company. As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it will be intriguing to see how other companies respond to this trend of rewarding employees in such a tangible and engaging manner. Will we see more studios following suit?
