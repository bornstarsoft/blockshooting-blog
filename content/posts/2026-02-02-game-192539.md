In a significant shift for gamers, Respawn has announced that the Nintendo Switch version of Apex Legends will be shutting down this summer, specifically on August 4, 2026. This decision comes as the studio prepares to transition players to the upcoming Switch 2 version, ensuring that those who upgrade can retain their in-game currency. This move highlights the evolving landscape of gaming platforms and the importance of staying updated with hardware advancements.

Players currently enjoying Apex Legends on Switch will have until the shutdown date to spend their Apex Coins, as these will not transfer to other platforms. While items purchased on Switch can be used across different systems, the currency remains exclusive to the Nintendo ecosystem. This means that players must either utilize their balance or upgrade to the new console to keep their funds intact.

As we look ahead, the transition to the Switch 2 promises to enhance the gaming experience with improved technical capabilities. Respawn expresses gratitude to the Nintendo community for their support since the game's launch. Will you be making the switch to the new console, or will you explore other platforms for your Apex Legends adventures?
