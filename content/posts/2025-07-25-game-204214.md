Cygames has officially announced the upcoming Legend Races for Umamusume: Pretty Derby, featuring fan-favorite characters Taiki Shuttle and Curren Chan among others. Set to kick off on July 27, 2025, these races promise exciting gameplay and the chance to earn Star Pieces, which are essential for unlocking new characters. With the inclusion of King Halo and Sakura Bakushin O, players can anticipate a thrilling race lineup that mirrors the Japanese schedule.

Each Legend Race allows players to compete against well-built characters, earning valuable rewards like Star Pieces, Carats, and Monies. Notably, the First Win Bonus provides a significant boost, making it crucial for players to strategize their racing tactics. Curren Chan, debuting as a Pace strategy character, adds a fresh dynamic to the game, especially for those who prefer sprinting on Turf.
