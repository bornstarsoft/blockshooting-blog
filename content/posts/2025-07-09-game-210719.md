When you think of competitive esports, titles like fast-paced shooters and complex MOBAs often come to mind. However, the recent showcase of Blue Prince during the Summer Games Done Quick event has proven that even a single-player puzzle game can captivate audiences as a thrilling spectator sport. Speedrunners Randringtail and BobbyBurm engaged in a riveting B Quest Bingo race, turning the games intricate mechanics into an electrifying competition.

The format was simple yet challenging: both players raced against the clock to complete objectives on a bingo board based on Blue Princes layout. With 90 minutes to fill in a path between the entrance hall and the antechamber, the tension was palpable, showcasing not only their mastery of the game but also their ability to adapt under pressure. This event highlighted how Blue Princes depth and complexity can translate into an engaging competitive format, reminiscent of watching grandmasters in a high-stakes chess match.

As gaming continues to evolve, it raises the question: what other genres could potentially become the next big thing in esports? The success of Blue Prince at GDQ may just be the tip of the iceberg for innovative competitive formats in gaming.
