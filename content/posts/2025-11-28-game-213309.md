In the ever-evolving landscape of video game development, Tose Software has emerged as a pivotal player, often operating behind the scenes. Recent reports reveal that Atlus has been Tose's biggest client, contributing a staggering 22.3% to the companys total revenue in the past fiscal year. This highlights not only Tose's significant role in the industry but also the growing reliance of major publishers on independent developers to bring their visions to life.

Founded in 1979, Tose has built a reputation as a ghost developer, collaborating with industry giants like Nintendo, Square Enix, and Bandai Namco without receiving public credit for their work. Their portfolio includes notable projects such as the Dragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake and Tales of Graces f Remastered. With Square Enix also increasing its share of Tose's revenue to 16.9%, its clear that the demand for Toses expertise is on the rise.

As the gaming industry continues to expand, the contributions of companies like Tose are crucial. Will we see more recognition for these behind-the-scenes heroes in the future? Only time will tell.
