A recent listing for a Switch 2 version of Assassins Creed Shadows on a French retailer's website has ignited excitement among gamers. This leak not only hints at an impending official announcement but also suggests that Ubisoft is keen on expanding its portfolio for the next-gen console. With the game already listed alongside box art, it seems the transition to Switch 2 is not just a rumor but a tangible reality.

The anticipation surrounding Assassins Creed Shadows has been building since its appearance on the PEGI site back in April, where it was among the most searched titles. Although the PEGI listing did not explicitly confirm the Switch 2 version, the recent retailer leak adds weight to the speculation. Following the successful port of Ubisofts Star Wars Outlaws, players are now more receptive to the idea of Assassins Creed Shadows making its way to the Switch 2, especially after positive feedback on the performance of that title.

As we await an official confirmation from Ubisoft, the gaming community is left to ponder: will Assassins Creed Shadows be the title that redefines the franchise on the Switch 2? Only time will tell, but the prospects are certainly thrilling for fans of the series.
