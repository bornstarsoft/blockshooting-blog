The release of iRacing's NASCAR 25 Console game marks a significant moment for fans of NASCAR gaming, especially with its extensive selection of base paint schemes. This game not only brings back beloved designs but also introduces a variety of new ones, including the debut of the ARCA Menards Series in a NASCAR console game. With such a diverse lineup, players can immerse themselves in the rich visual history of NASCAR while enjoying the thrill of racing.

However, it's essential to note that some fan-favorite paint schemes and sponsors are missing from this edition. Notably absent are the Monster Energy cars and certain alcoholic beverage-sponsored vehicles, which may disappoint some players. Still, the inclusion of iconic brands like Red Bull, making its return since NASCAR The Game: 2011, adds a nostalgic touch that many will appreciate.

As we look ahead, the evolution of paint schemes in racing games will likely continue to captivate fans. What other brands or designs do you hope to see in future releases?
