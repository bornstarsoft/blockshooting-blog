In a recent announcement, Gearbox has confirmed that the standard edition of Borderlands 4 will retail for $70, quelling earlier speculation about a potential $80 price tag. This decision comes after CEO Randy Pitchford faced backlash for suggesting that "real fans" would find a way to pay higher prices for games. The confirmation of the $70 price point aims to reassure fans while also addressing the rising costs associated with game development.

Alongside the standard edition, Gearbox is offering a $130 Super Deluxe Edition and a $150 Collectorâ€™s Edition, which intriguingly does not include the game itself. The studio has also promised a wealth of post-launch content, including new characters, regions, and story missions, indicating a commitment to delivering value for players, regardless of the edition they choose.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, with companies like Nintendo and Microsoft adopting higher price points, Gearbox's decision to maintain a $70 standard edition may set a precedent for future releases. Will this approach resonate with gamers, or will the conversation around game pricing continue to escalate?
