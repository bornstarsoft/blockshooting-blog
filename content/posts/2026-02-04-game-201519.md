Nintendo continues to expand its Nintendo Classics library on Switch Online, recently adding two beloved Game Boy titles: Balloon Kid and Yoshi. With these additions, the total number of Game Boy and Game Boy Color games available in the West has reached an impressive 43, offering gamers a nostalgic trip down memory lane.

Balloon Kid, a sequel to the NES classic Balloon Fight, invites players to guide Alice through various challenging stages as she searches for her brother Jim. Unlike its predecessor, Balloon Kid allows players to detach and re-inflate balloons, adding a unique twist to the gameplay. Meanwhile, Yoshi, developed by Game Freak, is a Tetris-style puzzle game that has players matching Mario series enemies, showcasing the creative diversity of early Nintendo titles.

With a standard Switch Online subscription costing as little as $3.99 per month, accessing these classic games has never been easier. As Nintendo continues to enrich its library, one can't help but wonder what other hidden gems might be on the horizon for retro gaming enthusiasts.
