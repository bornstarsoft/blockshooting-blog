A Grand Theft Auto game set in Tokyo was closer to reality than many fans might have imagined. According to Obbe Vermeij, a former technical director at Rockstar North, plans were in place for an external studio in Japan to develop GTA: Tokyo using Rockstars game code. However, the project ultimately fell through, leaving fans to wonder what a Tokyo-based installment could have brought to the franchise.

Vermeij's insights reveal that there were ambitions to expand the GTA universe beyond its familiar American settings, with ideas for games set in cities like Rio de Janeiro, Moscow, and Istanbul. Yet, as development times grew longer and the series became synonymous with satirical depictions of US cities, the likelihood of exploring global locales diminished. With GTA 6 on the horizon, it seems that the franchise may remain anchored to its American roots.

As we look forward to the next installment, one can't help but wonder: will Rockstar ever revisit the idea of taking GTA to new international heights, or are we destined to circle back to the same iconic cities?
