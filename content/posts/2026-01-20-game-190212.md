If you find joy in tidiness and organization, then the upcoming game Hozy might just be your next obsession. This delightful sandbox puzzle game combines elements of cleaning and decorating, reminiscent of the popular titles Unpacking and PowerWash Simulator. With its charming aesthetics and engaging gameplay, Hozy offers a unique experience that allows players to unleash their creativity while maintaining a sense of order.

In Hozy, players are tasked with cleaning and decorating various rooms, starting with a blank canvas. The gameplay is intuitive; you can easily gather trash into floating balls and dispose of them, followed by cleaning windows and painting walls. The real fun begins when you unpack furniture from moving boxes and arrange them as you see fit. Unlike Unpacking, Hozy grants you the freedom to place items wherever you want, making it a perfect outlet for those who love to curate their space meticulously.

While there are minor glitches, like the fairy lights clipping through the floor, the overall experience is satisfying and relaxing. As we eagerly await its release, one can't help but wonder how Hozy will evolve and what new features might be introduced. Will it become the go-to game for neat freaks and creative souls alike? Only time will tell.
