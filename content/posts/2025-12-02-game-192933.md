Starting today, VGC is launching an exciting Patreon Christmas pledge drive aimed at expanding our festive content and providing our community with more rewards than ever before. By contributing to [Patreon.com/VideoGamesChronicle](https://www.patreon.com/VideoGamesChronicle), you can help unlock some of our most-requested future videos, shows, and much more, all while enjoying the holiday spirit.

Throughout December, every new, gifted, or upgraded membership will contribute points to an overall total. As this total increases, well unveil stretch goals that include deep dives into our magazine archives, special appearances, commentary tracks for classic video game movies, and even plans for a unique celebration of the site and the VGC Podcast if we reach our highest goal. The content unlocked during this drive will be shared throughout December and early January, ensuring your festive break is packed with VGC goodness.

This initiative not only supports independent games media but also fosters a sense of community among gaming enthusiasts. Are you ready to join us in making this holiday season unforgettable for gamers everywhere?
