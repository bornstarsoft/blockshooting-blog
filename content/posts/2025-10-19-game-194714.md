After two decades of anticipation, the legendary Infinity on Game Boy Color is finally set to release in Q4 of 2025. This tactical RPG, originally developed by Affinix Software, has been resurrected by Incube8 Games, transforming a long-canceled project into a fully realized game just in time for the holiday season. With a unique strategic battle system and an engaging plot, Infinity promises to captivate both nostalgic gamers and newcomers alike.

Originally canceled in 2002, Infinity gained a cult following after an unfinished version was released as a free ROM in 2016. The excitement surrounding its revival was palpable, leading to a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2021. Now, with over 30 explorable areas and more than 100 items, players can immerse themselves in a beautifully crafted 8-bit world filled with rich storytelling and tactical gameplay.

As we look forward to the release, it's clear that Infinity is not just a game; it's a testament to the enduring love for retro gaming. Will this revival set a new standard for how we view classic titles? Only time will tell.
