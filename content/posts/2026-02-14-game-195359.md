The 2026 Taipei International Game Show showcased the vibrant and engaging booth of "Dolls Frontline 2: Exilium," attracting a diverse crowd of fans and cosplayers. With its interactive memory puzzle game, the booth not only highlighted the characters from the game but also encouraged players to engage more deeply by linking their commander levels to gameplay advantages. This unique blend of gaming and cosplay created an electrifying atmosphere that resonated with attendees.

Cosplayers brought beloved characters to life, including the striking "Macchiato" and the alluring "Sentau Lacey" in a swimsuit, captivating the audience with their creativity and enthusiasm. The presence of characters like "Suomi" and "Kunkai" in both battle and swimsuit attire showcased the duality of the game's aesthetic, appealing to fans of all kinds. The event was a perfect example of how gaming conventions can foster community and excitement around popular titles.

As we reflect on the success of the Dolflo 2 booth, it raises the question: how will future gaming events continue to innovate and engage fans in ways that blend technology, creativity, and community? Let's keep an eye on the evolving landscape of gaming culture!
