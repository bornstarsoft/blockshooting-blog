Capcom's upcoming title, Pragmata, is set to redefine the puzzle-shooter genre with its innovative gameplay mechanics. In a recent gameplay reveal, the game showcased a unique blend of puzzle-solving and shooting, where players must hack robots through a mini-game while simultaneously dodging their attacks. This duality not only adds a layer of complexity but also keeps players engaged in a fast-paced environment.

Set in a near-future lunar research station, players will step into the shoes of Hugh, a combat-ready spaceman, alongside his android companion, Diana. The game's narrative, combined with its striking visuals and polished gameplay, promises an immersive experience that fans of Capcom's rich history in gaming will appreciate. Despite its delays, the excitement surrounding Pragmata continues to build, especially after positive impressions from early previews.

As we look forward to its release in 2026, one can't help but wonder how Capcom will expand on these initial ideas over the course of a potentially lengthy adventure. Will Pragmata live up to the high expectations set by its intriguing premise? Only time will tell.
