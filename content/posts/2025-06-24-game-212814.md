A pre-release build of the highly anticipated but ultimately axed PS5 game, Concord, has surfaced online, providing an intriguing glimpse into what could have been. This development build, known as FWChaos, is reportedly dated November 14, 2023, which means it was compiled just nine months before the gameâ€™s planned launch in August 2024. The authenticity of the build has been confirmed by VGC, raising questions about the game's development process and the reasons behind its cancellation.

Upon loading the game, players are greeted with a login screen that cannot be bypassed. However, a developer menu can be accessed through an included .ini file, allowing users to explore a Select Freegunner screen. Unfortunately, it seems that players are unable to proceed further, as no characters are available for selection. The build does offer a peek into various menus, including a Galactic Guide and a Crew section detailing 16 playable characters and their outfits, hinting at the game's expansive universe.

The presence of a Job Board and a Store option, albeit non-functional, suggests that the developers were working on a robust in-game economy and mission structure. Additionally, the Settings menu reveals developer options that could have provided a unique multiplayer experience. As we reflect on this leak, it raises the question: what could have led to the cancellation of such an ambitious project, and what lessons can be learned for future game development?
