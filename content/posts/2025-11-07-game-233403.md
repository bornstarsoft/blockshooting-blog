In a significant turn of events, Bad Brain Game Studios, a subsidiary of NetEase, has announced its impending shutdown due to unsuccessful attempts to secure a new partner for its project, Midnight Riders. This closure, set for November 17th, 2025, underscores the challenges faced by game developers in an increasingly competitive landscape, particularly when it comes to securing funding and partnerships.

Founded in 2023 with a team of former Ubisoft Toronto staff, Bad Brain Game Studios was part of NetEase's expansion into the Canadian gaming market. However, it now joins the ranks of other NetEase subsidiaries, like Fantastic Pixel Castle, which are also closing their doors. This trend raises questions about the sustainability of overseas investments in the gaming industry, especially as NetEase reportedly scales back its international operations.

As Bad Brain Game Studios prepares to close, they remain open to acquisition opportunities, highlighting the potential for other publishers or studios to step in and continue the development of Midnight Riders. Will this serve as a wake-up call for other developers to reassess their partnership strategies? Only time will tell as the gaming industry continues to evolve.
