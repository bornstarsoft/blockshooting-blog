Ubisoft is currently facing scrutiny over its approach to game accessibility, especially in light of the Stop Killing Games petition, which has garnered nearly 1.4 million signatures. This movement calls for regulations to prevent game publishers from making purchased titles unplayable after official support ends. During a recent shareholder meeting, CEO Yves Guillemot acknowledged the challenge of maintaining game accessibility, stating that it is an issue all game publishers contend with.

Guillemot emphasized that while Ubisoft strives to provide ongoing support for its games, the reality is that no service is eternal. He pointed out that the industry is working collectively to address these concerns, and that the lifecycle of software often leads to obsolescence. The backlash following the shutdown of The Crew has highlighted the urgency of this issue, prompting Ubisoft to consider offline modes for its titles.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, the question remains: how can publishers balance the need for innovation with the responsibility to preserve their existing titles for future generations? This ongoing dialogue will be crucial in shaping the future of gaming and ensuring that players can enjoy their purchases long after the initial release.
