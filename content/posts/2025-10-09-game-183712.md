Nintendo Switch Online has just made a significant addition to its SNES library, unveiling three classic games, including the long-awaited international release of "Mario & Wario." This marks a historic moment for fans, as it is the first time this unique Mario-themed puzzle platformer has been made available outside of Japan.

"Mario & Wario," developed by Game Freak before their Pokmon fame, challenges players to guide Mario through 100 levels filled with obstacles, all while he is blinded by Wario's antics. The game originally required a Super Famicom Mouse, making its arrival on Switch Online a groundbreaking moment, as it now utilizes the Joy-Con for mouse functionality. Alongside this, the library also welcomes "Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind" and "Fatal Fury Special," enriching the gaming experience for nostalgic players.

As Nintendo continues to revive and expand its classic game offerings, one can't help but wonder what other hidden gems might be unearthed in the future. Will we see more beloved titles making their way to a global audience? Only time will tell.
