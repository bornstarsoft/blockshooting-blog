In a bold move to protect its brand, YS Net, the studio founded by legendary game designer Yu Suzuki, has publicly denied any affiliation with a purported Shenmue 4 trailer that has been circulating on social media. The studio's statement reveals that the video, which allegedly showcases footage from the next installment of the beloved RPG series, is likely AI-generated and misleadingly uses their logo without permission.

The studio emphasized that they have not released any official trailers or promotional materials for Shenmue 4, and they consider the matter serious enough to potentially pursue legal action. This incident highlights the growing concerns around misinformation and the misuse of branding in the gaming industry, especially as AI technology becomes more prevalent in content creation.

As fans eagerly await news about Shenmue 4, YS Net's commitment to ensuring accurate information is crucial. Will this incident prompt a broader discussion about the responsibilities of content creators and the impact of AI in the gaming community? Let's hope for clarity and authenticity in the future of gaming communications.
