Today marks an exciting milestone for developers as the Agent Development Kit (ADK) welcomes Go into its family of supported languages. This addition empowers developers to create sophisticated AI agents with the flexibility and control that ADK offers, all while using a language that aligns with their existing tech stack. With Go's strong typing and concurrency features, building robust and scalable applications has never been easier.

ADK is designed for those who crave fine-grained control over their AI agents, allowing you to orchestrate agent behavior and tool usage directly in your code. This means you can implement rigorous debugging, reliable versioning, and enjoy the freedom to deploy your applications anywherefrom your local machine to the cloud. The introduction of ADK for Go not only enhances your development experience but also integrates seamlessly with over 30 databases, simplifying data management.

Moreover, the inclusion of the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol in ADK Go enables developers to construct powerful multi-agent systems. This feature allows for collaboration among agents, making it possible to tackle complex problems through delegation and orchestration. As you embark on this journey of building innovative AI agents, what groundbreaking solutions will you create with ADK for Go?
