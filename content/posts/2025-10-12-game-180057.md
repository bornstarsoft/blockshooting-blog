The recent launch of NASCAR 25, developed by iRacing, has generated significant excitement among racing enthusiasts, particularly with the revelation of driver ratings. Among the over 170 drivers featured in the game, only three have achieved a perfect score of 100, making this a noteworthy highlight for fans and gamers alike.

William Byron, the cover star of NASCAR 25, stands out as the sole driver from the NASCAR Cup Series to earn this accolade. Joining him are Connor Zilisch from the NASCAR Xfinity Series and Corey Heim from the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. This exclusive 100-club not only showcases the exceptional talent of these drivers but also adds an intriguing layer of competition within the game.

As players dive into the various modes of NASCAR 25, the perfect ratings will undoubtedly influence gameplay strategies and fan discussions. With the game now available, how will these ratings impact the online racing community and the future of NASCAR gaming?
