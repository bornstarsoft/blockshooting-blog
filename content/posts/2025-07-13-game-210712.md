If youre a fan of indie horror games, now is the perfect time to grab a unique title thats currently available for free on Steam. Haus Of Irndrous, developed by Yxtopia Studios, is an atmospheric horror puzzle game that will soon transition to a paid model. Players have until July 19, 2025, to claim their copy at no cost, after which it will be priced at $1.99.

Initially launched in early access in August 2024, Haus Of Irndrous was designed to be an episodic experience, with the first chapter offered for free while subsequent episodes were to be paid content. However, Yxtopia Studios recently announced a shift in their pricing strategy, making this a rare opportunity for gamers to experience the game without any financial commitment. This trend of transitioning from free-to-play to paid models is becoming more common, as seen with other titles like ROTA: Bend Gravity.

As the gaming landscape evolves, its fascinating to see how developers adapt their strategies to engage players. Will you seize the opportunity to add Haus Of Irndrous to your library before the price tag kicks in? Dont miss out on this chilling experience!
