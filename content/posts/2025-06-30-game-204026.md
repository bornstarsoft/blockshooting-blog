Nintendo has officially announced the release of Drag x Drive for the Nintendo Switch 2, set to launch on August 14, 2025, at a price of $30 AUD. This innovative game allows players to use their Joy-Con controllers in mouse mode, simulating arm movements to steer and drive a wheelchair in a thrilling 3-on-3 basketball match. The unique control scheme is not just a gimmick; it significantly enhances the gameplay experience, making it more engaging than it appeared in its initial reveal.

Having had the chance to play Drag x Drive for about thirty minutes at the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience in Melbourne, I was pleasantly surprised by how well the mouse controls functioned. The game proved to be much more exciting in practice than it seemed during its first showcase. As we look forward to its release, it raises the question: how will this innovative approach to gameplay shape the future of sports games on consoles?
